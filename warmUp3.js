// 1 - Write functions larger and smaller that each accept two strings as arguments, and return the larger and smaller strings, respectively

// 2 - Write a function called counter that, when invoked, always returns a number that is one more than the previous invocation. For instance:
// function counting(n) { 
    TODO: your code here 
// } 
// counting(5); // => '1, 2, 3, 4, 5' 
// counting(1); // => '1' 
// counting(3); // => '1, 2, 3'


// 3 -  Meet & Greet: n numbers are coming to a party for numbers. Introduce them each to all the guests as they arrive. You should end up with output looking something like this one for n = 5
// welcome 1
//  welcome 2, meet 1
//  welcome 3, meet 1 and 2
//  welcome 4, meet 1, 2 and 3
//  welcome 5, meet 1, 2, 3 and 4
//

// 4- Write a function shortestWord that works like longestWord, but returns the shortest word instead.
