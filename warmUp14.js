//create a function isSubset that should take two arrays and determine whether the second array is a subset of the first array.
//For example:

// array: [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], sub:[ 2, 3, 4 ] => true
// array: [ 2, 2, 2, 3, 4 ], sub:[ 2, 4, 3 ] => true
// array: [ 2, 3, 3, "a" ],  sub:[ 3, 3, 3, "a" ] => false
